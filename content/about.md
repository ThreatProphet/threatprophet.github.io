Many witness the plague. Few trace it to its source.


ThreatProphet exists at the intersection of darkness and signal, where the wicked leave traces of transgression they believe no one will find, where infrastructure whispers its origins, where malware reveals the hand that wrote it.
This is not a news feed. It is a record of what was found in the shadows.

The ancient prophets did not choose their visions. They were chosen by them.
So it is here. The threats find me. I simply write them down.

## Domains of Interest

- Threat intelligence & adversary tracking
- Malware analysis & campaign attribution
- Cyber warfare & state-sponsored operations
- Infrastructure analysis & OSINT
- The spaces between, where none of the above categories quite fit

## On Anonymity

ThreatProphet is an alias. It will remain one.
The work speaks. The name does not matter.
